      Maybe this should be first? Chances are you already know. Chances are you
      know because you have to have it. The **Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)** is
      prized in modern transactional reporting due to an **inherent unambiguous
      nature**. This means computers like to eat it. The LEI came into vogue
      after the global financial crisis of 2008 exposed entity identification as
      a key fault line. **A LEI crystallizes any company into a 20-character,
      machine-readable code**. One LEI will always equal one legal entity.
      Sounds basic. It is. Seminal. And with functional administration by a G-20
      backed consortium, expect LEI usage to grow in the 2020s as _the company
      ID number_ of choice.

    content: "ISO 17442 [defines the information](https://www.iso.org/standard/75998.html) readable from each code. A LEI **will always** contain:\n\n1.\tThe official name of the legal entity.\n\n2.\tThe registered address of the legal entity.\n\n3.\tThe country of formation.\n\n4.\tThe codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions.\n\n5.\tThe date of the first LEI assignment.\n\n6.\tThe date of last update of the LEI information.\n\n7.\tThe date of expiry.\n\nThat's the **minimum**. In the GLEIF nomenclature, the seven points above are referred to as _Level 1 data_: irrefutably answering **Who is Who** within the Global LEI system.\n\nBut additional information might be included. These extra data points **are not required** during registration and thus LOUs and Registration Agents are under no obligation to demand **Level 2 data** from an applicant. You can opt out for a variety of reasons. Level 2 data establishes **Who Owns Whom**. This robust, higher-order information requires upload of accounting documents in order to _verify the consolidation of many entities into one LEI_. Only large organizations have utility here. Level 2 data can eliminate internal errors as well as strengthening the Global LEI system."

      All LEIs have a strict, 20-character structure. Let's look at what each
      character set can tell us:


      ### Characters 1-4
       Prefix used to identify the LOU who issued the LEI code.

      ### Characters 5-18

      Entity specific part of the code issued by the LOU according to ISO 17442.


      ### Characters 19-20

      Check digits used to verify the LEI.

        question: Who are you?
      - answer: >-
          Short rundown: **We get and maintain LEIs so you don't have to**.
          Whether you're a one-person operation, professional with a mid-sized
          suite, or megalith corporation. Register or extend a Legal Entity
          Identifier. 
        question: What do you do?
      - answer: Maybe. Depends on the rules of engagement in your jurisdiction.
        question: Do I need a LEI?
      - answer: >-
          Maybe this should be first? Chances are you already know. Chances are
          you know because you have to have it. The **Legal Entity Identifier
          (LEI)** is prized in modern transactional reporting due to an
          **inherent unambiguous nature**. This means computers like to eat it.
          The LEI came into vogue after the global financial crisis of 2008

          crystallizes any company into a 20-character, machine-readable code**.
          One LEI will always equal one legal entity. Sounds basic. It is.
          Seminal. And with functional administration by a G-20 backed
          consortium, expect LEI usage to grow in the 2020s as _the company ID
          number_ of choice.
        question: What is a LEI?
      - answer: >-
          Any entity which can be verified as existing can apply for a LEI.
          There are different procedures for verifying your entity which depends
          on if it exists in an external company registration database. If it
          does not, we will request the proper documentation to certify.
