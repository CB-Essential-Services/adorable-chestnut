title: What is the Deal with LEI Renewals
---
Taking a hard position, **annual renewal of your Legal Entity Identifier is required**. By the [GLEIF](undefined). They bake it into the LEI record. **A red or green dot indicates whether the LEI has been renewed** within the required time frame. Why demand renewals? So data can be self-attested. The registrant accounts for changes in company name, address, ownership structure, and officer roles. Or simply affirms nothing has changed. Anything can be[ challenged by an outside ](https://www.gleif.org//en/lei-data/challenge-lei-data) party. 

## Red LAPSED -- ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ

When looking at a LEI record, a red dot next to the word Lapsed under Registration Status shows the entity has failed to renew.

Globally, 30.8% of LEIs are Lapsed. Let's consider some factors for why this might be:

- **Enforceability:** Implementation occurs on a jurisdictional basis. The GLEIF works very hard as a non-profit to promote best practices surrounding LEI data quality, but enforcement is left to regulatory bodies overseeing areas where LEI usage has been implemented. View a comprehensive list here. Firms are required or requested to have a LEI; whether the annual renewal standard is met is often inconsequential. 
 
- **Cost:** Renewing a LEI costs money. Generally, the cost of renewal will be less than registration. But what reason is there spend money less any material penalty?  

- **Awareness:** Firms deal with an array of mental burdens. Renewing a LEI costs time. Employees charged with management may be unaware of the requirement or prioritize other duties. Outsourcing to a dedicated provider could help solve this issue.

## Green ISSUED --  \(￣︶￣*\))

Still, the [necessity is obvious](https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/20180418_gfma_lei_webinar.pdf) for some. Those subject to MiFID II operate under a strict _no-LEI-no-TRADE_ rule. This policy [demands fresh data](http://www.finregalert.com/mifid-iis-lei-requirements-transaction-reporting/) yearly. But that's not everyone. Why else would doing annual LEI renewals be beneficial?

- **Public Image:** As a primary record bearing essential details, an out-of-date Registration Status can reduce trust. LEI records are 100% open-source and viewable to the public.

- **Conformity Flag:** Besides the green or red dot, look for a holistic compliance indicator to appear on all LEI records in 2021. GLEIF CEO [Stephen Wolf referenced roll-out](https://www.gfma.org/event/gfma-lei-webinar-3/) of the Conformity Flag feature during a recent webinar. Registration Status will contribute to entities being deemed in alignment with LEI ROC policy, and thus suitable for receiving the binary indicator.

- **Improved KYC/KYB:** Further [expedite on-boarding](https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/why-get-an-lei/), KYC, and any other validation process which uses the LEI. Applications built on a Lapsed Registration Status suffer. Reconciliation against other data sources will take longer. Staying current means checks are more likely to be validated. Less work keeps everyone happy. 

## Solution: Extend, Extend, Extend

We call it Extension because the LEI can always be renewed. Falling into a Lapsed status doesn't mean your company will suffer any penalties, unless mandated so by a specific piece of reporting. The GLEIF will never stand in the way of a business wanting to self-attest fresh, up-to-date data. This is essential for maintaining the LEI system's integrity as a whole. Extend before or after your renewal date. 

The renewal date will be set **exactly 1-year** from the date the LEI was issued. Not when you payed for it. Obtain the date from the LEI record. A subscription-based service automates payment, making LEI renewal a set-it-and-forget-it business process. Outsourcing management can also be beneficial to companies with large portfolios. Otherwise, stay Issued through internal due diligence.

Your 20-digit code will never change; not if renewed, not if management transfers from one LOU to another. The LEI encapsulates **one legal entity** forever within its alphanumeric code. Choose a dedicated provider and automated payment to assure your LEI never slips through the compliance cracks. As a living business record, promote the ultimate in corporate-facing trust.
