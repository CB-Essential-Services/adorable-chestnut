title: Top 5 Reasons To Get A Legal Entity Identifier
---
### 1. The LEI code is the most important global identifier.

- The LEI was created as a result of the 2008 financial crisis to
deliver strong organization identity for counter-parties.

- LEIs protect citizens during market crises by providing
understanding of dependencies and risk exposure.

- Endorsed by the G20 and the Financial Stability Board, and
regulated by the Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF).

### 2. The LEI enables compliant, cross-border transactions.

- NO LEI, NO TRADE : non-compliance with certain
regulations risks fines and no-trade penalties.

- LEIs are made mandatory by MiFID, MiFIR, Dodd-Frank Act,
EMIR and many other regulations.

- New regulations mandating LEI inclusion go live every
month.

### 3. The LEI code enables trust in your organization's legitimacy and identity.

- Data providers and credit check organizations utilize LEIs in
Know-Your-Customer (KYC) on-boarding, and client identity
refresh processes.

- Missing LEIs cause disruptions in business activities, deals, and
transactions.

- LEIs are the primary connector between all the regional and
private sector organization identifiers.

### 4. LEI records contain valuable, accurate, and transparent identity data attributes.

- Both humans and machines can verify the LEI.

- The entire LEI database is open and searchable via web, full dataset download, or API.

- LEIs provide up-to-date organization identity.

- The LEI is the only identifier to connect parent
and children organizations.

- LEIs support multiple languages for names and
addresses.

### 5. LEIs enable applications to utilize your strong organizational identity.

- LEIs are included in electronic / digital signatures, documents,
press releases, site seals, QR codes, bar codes, and more.

- Human & machine-readable XBRL Digital Signatures are
linked to LEI for permanent certainty about integrity of
document such as annual reports and financial statements.

- LEIs are now included in x.509 digital certificates.

- LEIs will be included in SWIFT transactions in the new ISO
payment standard.
