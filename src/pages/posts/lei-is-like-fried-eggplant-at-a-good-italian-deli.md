title: Why an LEI is a Baller Thing To Have
---
The best! Imagine that. Second day of work and you get to sit down with the Boss. No less: At the table in the room next door which is under construction to get attached. To a beloved deli. He sits down and watches his phone. Flicks fingers around a bit. I mutter about the eggplant: The best! Without looking up the Boss says so. You know it is true. **You have never had eggplant quite like this and the LEI is a strange equivalence to make but we know it too is the best at what it does.** ID your company in a non-reputable, unambiguous way. Get creative and unlock new value by putting it with other ingredients (on-boarding, KYC). Start with the best and make it into a perfect sandwich.
