title: Strange Story of a Man on the Block
---
I grew up on a street with a dead end. The dead end looked off into the marsh at one end. Going around the horseshoe loop at the end of the block and moving back towards entering from the boulevard, that row of houses would face off into the bay.

In the end, I could not help but to glean this information I had learned about that man on our block (you know?? the one who walks dogs), sharing it on my sisters and a privileged cousin at a holiday party of our own (Ah! the times). And of course we shared a laugh. Either way, one should be aware of this odd bit of evidence while deciding to click the **Hire Registered Agent** button.
