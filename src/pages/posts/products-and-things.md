title: Products Versus Things
---
To not participate in the world of products seems at once presumptious
and impossible. Products are a special class of things. Products must
come into existence. Things present
themselves to us in full sparkling immanence. The origin of a Thing is impossible
to understand. The origin of a Product is understandable, and a great source of frustration
when it cannot be.
The origin is understandable as the part of some relation. The fullness of this
relation is obscured. The relations of a Thing are not so clear. Their
coming-into-being is unquestioned.
