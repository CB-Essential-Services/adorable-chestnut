      As far as I know, we are the first company in the United States to offer
      an automated LEI issuance program. We do this by having a great Partner.
      RapidLEI is the LOU. If you're unsure what a LOU is, discover more or take
      this brief summation: a Local Operating Unit (LOU) is the entity which
      generates the LEI in compliance with ISO 17442. We manage the LEI. Each
      year, it needs to be renewed. If you are a part of an organization which
      essentializes LEIs appearing Issued on record, this is the best program to
      make it happen. As long as the subscription payment from your end hits our
      account, an automatic renewal will be triggered with the GLEIF. Managing
      all the background research is up to us, although we'd appreciate if any
      address, ownership change, or other data points could be relayed if
      updated. You'll get an email reminder a month before the LEI is set to
      renew. We just want you to be aware of the charge on its way. If
      everything is good, sit tight. Don't worry.


      We've invested long and hard winnowing down the LEI registration and
      maintenance process. We've optimized our processes to keep your code
      Issued. It's our hope that through relieving this small compliance burden,
      a relationship can grow as we continue to expand and offer a more lengthy
      variety of benefits. Take calm knowing we're on the ground floor. Start
      with secure company identification. Grow from there. We hope to join you
      on your journey.
